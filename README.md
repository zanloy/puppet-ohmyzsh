# for a single user
ohmyzsh::install { 'user1': }

# for multiple users in one shot and set their shell to zsh
ohmyzsh::install { ['root', 'user1']: set_sh => true }

# install and disable prompt for automatic updates
ohmyzsh::install { 'user2': disable_auto_update => true }

# install a theme for a user
ohmyzsh::fetch::theme { 'root': url => 'http://zanloy.com/files/dotfiles/oh-my-zsh/squared.zsh-theme' }

# set a theme for a user
ohmyzsh::theme { ['root', 'user1']: } # would install 'clean' theme as default

ohmyzsh::theme { ['root', 'user1']: theme => 'robbyrussell' } # specific theme

# activate plugins for a user
ohmyzsh::plugins { 'user1': plugins => ['git', 'github'] }
